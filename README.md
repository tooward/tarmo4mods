# tarmo4mods
CAD files for modifications of the Tarmo 4 RC car.

Used the [Tarmo 4](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4178426) as a basis for learning Fusion 360. Figured some of these modifications might be of interest to others so sharing here. I'll post STL files on Thingiverse once it's more evolved.

Changes:
- Removed the need for the battery box and brackets (04A, 04B, 04C) by widening the chasis sufficiently to place the battery to the side. Currently just a slot for the battery but will add a cover to hold it in place soon.
- Added a basic cover which is really just an invested chassis. Modifications to the chassis to take the lid.

(and thanks to Kris for making this possible!)
